structures notes 

In C programming, a structure is a user-defined data type that allows you 
to combine different data types into a single entity. 
It provides a way to group related data together and organize it under a single name. 
Structures allow you to create complex data structures to represent real-world entities or concepts.

The syntax for defining a structure in C is as follows:

struct StructureName {
    dataType1 member1;
    dataType2 member2;
    // ... more members
};

The struct keyword is used to define a structure,
followed by the name of the structure (StructureName in the example above). 
Inside the curly braces, you specify the members of the structure, which can be of any valid C data type.

Once you have defined a structure, you can create variables of that structure type. 
For example:

struct StructureName variableName;

You can then access the members of the structure using the dot (.) operator.
For example:

variableName.member1 = value1;
variableName.member2 = value2;

data structures.

You can pass structures as function arguments and return them from functions. 
When passing structures as function arguments, you can pass them by value or by reference 
(using pointers). Passing structures by reference allows you to 
modify the original structure within the function.

Here are some key points to remember about structures in C:

Structures are used to group related data together.
They allow you to define custom data types.
Structure members can have different data types.
Structures can be nested within other structures.
You can access structure members using the dot (.) operator.
Structures can be passed as function arguments and returned from functions.
